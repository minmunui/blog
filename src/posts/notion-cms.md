Notion is more than just a note-taking app. It's a database.

## The Workflow

1. Write draft in Notion.
2. Change status to **Published**.
3. A script fetches the content via Notion API.
4. Content is converted to Markdown.
5. Site is rebuilt and deployed.

This allows me to write anywhere, even on my phone!
